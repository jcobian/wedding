# Wedding website

I figured I should make my own website for my wedding instead of paying someone or using some boring free templated thing on the internet.

## Architecture

Single page app served via web server running Flask

Same web server using Flask also has the API endpoints (easy for now)


## Local

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Now visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
